# Introduction to Python

Python is a jack-of-all-trades programming language that is free, flexible, open-source, cross-platform and has a very large community behind it. If you ask Python programmers what they like most about Python, they will often cite its high readability and high availability of good packages. There are many Python packages out there for geoscripting, data wrangling, visualization and machine learning. For example:

* Geoscripting
    * GeoPandas (Vector Processing)
    * Rasterio (Raster Processing)
    * GDAL/OGR (Vector and Raster Processing)
    * QGIS plugins (Open Source GIS)
    * ArcPy (Propietary GIS)
* Data Handling
    * Pandas (Dataframes and Data Analysis)
    * NumPy (Scientific Computing)
* Visualization
    * Matplotlib (General Graphics)
    * Seaborn (Statistical Graphics)
    * Folium (Interactive Maps)
* Machine Learning
    * scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
    * Keras + TensorFlow (Deep Learning)
    * PyTorch (Deep Learning)

## Python package management with Conda
A set of tools co-exist for installing and managing Python packages. It is possible to install packages on your base Python interpreter, but sooner or later you will get conflicting Python packages since packages have varying dependencies. It can even [break your system Python interpreter](https://askubuntu.com/questions/95037/what-is-the-best-way-to-install-python-packages).

Instead, we recommend to use a Python package manager that can make use of virtual environments, such as *Conda* or *Mamba*. That way, you can create a conda environment on your machine for each project. In conda environments, basically anything, such as software, C libraries or R packages can be installed. Here we use them here for installing Python packages. Packages installed in one environment do not interfere with your base Python or with other conda environments. Additionally, it is possible to export and share the requirements for your (open source) project with colaborators or users of your code. 

## Mamba installation
For this course, we will make use of *Mamba*, a fast drop-in reimplementation of the *Conda* package manager. It has its core parts implemented in C++ for maximum efficiency, makes use of parallel downloading of repository data and package files using multi-threading, and uses `libsolv` for (much) faster dependency solving. 
To install *Mamba* in your Linux environment, we have prepared a short *Bash* script for you. Just run the following lines of code, line by line, in a new terminal window.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/InstallLinuxScript.git
cd InstallLinuxScript/user
chmod u+x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

<!-- This should be kept for external students, TODO: think about how to combine this
```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
MINICONDA_VERSION="Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64"
pushd /tmp
curl -O https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/${MINICONDA_VERSION}.sh
## This installation script will require user input
bash ${MINICONDA_VERSION}.sh
rm ${MINICONDA_VERSION}.sh
popd
```

Scroll down the license with enter. Accept License (i.e. type yes). Use default install location (i.e. press Enter). When prompted to prepend the *Conda* install location to path agree (i.e. type yes). This makes the Python interpreter of *Conda* the standard Python interpreter and allows you to run *Conda* commands from command line. -->

This will install *Mamba* into `~/mamba`. Finally, restart your terminal to be able to use *Mamba* and *Conda* in the terminal. Next, let's see how to use *Mamba* in case you want make new virtual environments by yourself, or install packages after creating the environment.

## Mamba usage
*Mamba* creates isolated conda environments with sets of packages, that do not interfere with your base Python or with other conda environments. To create an environment:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
mamba create --name geotest python numpy
```

This would create a new environment called *geotest* with *Python*, *NumPy* and *Spyder* installed into the conda environment. Another option is to create an environment from a `.yaml` file, in which all required modules are listed. You will see an example of this later on in this tutorial. To create an environment from such a file, you can use the argument `--file` (or `--f` in short). 

Let's first list the currently available environments:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
mamba info --envs
```

*Mamba* puts an asterisk (\*) in front of the active environment. Now we activate the environment. While *Mamba* replaces *Conda* for most commands, this is not the case for (de)activating environments:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
# Cross-platform (but not always working, like in our VM, so we use the next option)
conda activate geotest

# Linux, macOS
source activate geotest

# Windows
activate geotest
```

After this, the current environment is shown in parentheses in front of your prompt (`(geotest)$`). Note that the activated environment is only valid for the shell in which you activated it. For instance, if you close the shell window and open a new one you will have to activate it again.

After creating a conda environment, (additional) Python packages can be installed. There are three possible ways to install packages, which we list below.

* Using *Mamba* to install and manage conda packages. This downloads conda packages using conda channels, which are URLs to directories containing the conda packages. **Generally, installing conda packages using *Mamba* is the preferred method.**
* Using *pip* to install packages and *Mamba* to manage these packages. *pip* is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. *pip* can also install [binary wheels on Windows](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/Pythonlibs). You should generally not install packages from *pip* in a conda environment unless it's the last resort. This is because after you use *pip* to modify an environment, you can no longer use `conda`/`mamba` to do so (trying that will break your environment, because *pip* does not communicate its changes to *Conda*). Hence install packages with `mamba` that you can first, and only then use `pip`, and then never touch the environment with `mamba` again (delete and start fresh if you need to).
* Using the distribution's package manager (only on Ubuntu, that is `sudo apt-get install python-*`).

The `mamba search` command searches a set of channels. By default, packages are automatically downloaded and updated from the default channel. To search for a package, type:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
mamba search pandas
```

This gives a list of all packages that have "pandas" in the name and lists all available versions. To install:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
mamba install pandas
```

This installs the latest compatible version of _Pandas_. Note that this would install it into your currently activated environment.

Note that you can also install multiple packages at the same time: 

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
mamba install geopandas matplotlib
```

As you saw with *Spyder* (which is an IDE, more on that later), *Mamba* is also able to install some non-Python packages that have Python bindings. This is useful for making sure your Python and binary versions match and do not interfere with the system-wide ones.

Some additional helpful utilities for package management in this context are:

* `mamba list` to check which packages are installed in `root` or in the active environment;
* `python --version` or `gdal-config --version` to check which Python or GDAL version is used in the environment;
* `which spyder` or `type spyder` to find out which *Spyder* executable is used either from system or conda environment.

Removing packages is just as simple:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
mamba remove geopandas pandas folium
```

Now, we deactivate the environment and return to base environment.

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
# Cross-platform
conda deactivate

# Linux, macOS
source deactivate

# Windows
deactivate
```

When we are finished, and do not need the environment for next time, we can remove the environment `geotest`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
mamba remove --name geotest --all
```


## Running a Python script in the terminal

Within a conda environment, Python can be started directly, or can be called to run a script file. To start Python directly:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
python
```

Now, you can type Python expressions that will be executed one by one:

```{Python,eval=FALSE, engine.path='/usr/bin/python3'}
import sys
print('Good morning, you are running Python:', sys.version)
```

To go back, type:
```{Python,engine.path='/usr/bin/python3', eval=FALSE}
exit()
# or 
quit()
```

Usually, we do not want to run expressions one by one, but build scripts instead, to ensure transferability and reproducibilty. Create a new text file and (re)name it (to) `test.py`. Open it, for example with a text editor, paste in the code you used above (`import sys` etc.), and save the script. Navigate in the terminal to the location where this script is stored, using `cd`. Finally, run the script with:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
python test.py
```

The output is printed to the terminal. Running a script from the terminal is less error-prone than running it from an IDE (see the next section), such as Spyder, as IDEs often keep variables in memory after the script has finished running. Therefore, running a script from the terminal is a good final test before submitting an exercise or assignment. 

## Python editors and IDEs
There are many Integrated Development Environments [IDE] for Python, and every programmer has their own preference. An IDE is a software application that provides facilities for software development.

* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) integrates visualization with code and is suitable to make tutorials, simple dashboards, quick visualizations, and do prototype testing. Jupyter Notebooks run in your browser on a localhost server or on a web server. They allow for various programming languages, e.g. Python, R, Julia, Spark or PySpark. 
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is a lightweight IDE. *In this course, Spyder is the recommended Python IDE.*
* [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/install-and-set-up-pycharm.html) is a free professional Python IDE with a lot of advanced functionality, such as integrated GIT version control, code completion, code checking, debugging and navigation. This IDE can optionally be used by more advanced scripters during this course instead of Spyder, but do know that you will not be assisted for solving IDE-related issues.

### Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks integrate code and visualization, and are therefore helpful for demonstration purposes. Install `jupyter` and the module `folium` in an existing or new environment that includes Python and start Jupyter:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter should pop up in your browser. You will see a menu with all files in your working directory. The Jupyter Notebook will only see files that are accessible from the working directory in which you launched the notebook!

Make a new folder: *New* → *Folder*, rename the folder (check the box next to the new 'Untitled Folder' and click **'Rename'** in the top) and, in this folder, create a new Python3 Jupyter Notebook *New* → *Python 3*. Give your notebook a name by clicking on *untitled*. Note that this creates a file with the extension *.ipynb*, which stands for Jupyter Notebook. 

Feel free to have a go at the user interface tour (*Help* → *User Interface Tour*), or hover over the toolbar to check out the tools. The main tools are:

- _Save and checkpoint_
- _Insert cell below_
- _Run_
- _Code/Markdown/Heading_ (List box)

Similar to RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebooks have code cells (*Code*) and text cells (*Markdown*). Insert two extra cells by clicking the + button and change the first cell from code to markdown. Enter some documentation for your code (e.g. your team name, exercise and date). Leave the other cell on code. 

Type the following Python code in the code cell:

```{Python,engine.path='/usr/bin/python3', eval=FALSE}
import folium

m = folium.Map(location=[51.9700000, 5.6666700], zoom_start=13)
m
```

Run the code cell by selecting it and pressing the *Run* button, or press *CTRL + Enter* or *Shift + Enter*. You'll see a map visualized below your code, similar to the one below. Try to drag the map to play around with it. 

<img src="images/WUR_Basic_Folium_Map.png" alt="Wageningen University Basic Folium map" width="100%"></img>

Your Jupyter Notebook is automatically saved as an `.ipynb` file on your computer (the file extension comes from the historic name "IPython Notebook"). The notebook can be downloaded as a Python script, pdf or html. You can also save it manually. 

To exit a notebook properly, use *File* → *Close and Halt*. After that, by pressing Ctrl + c in the terminal where Jupyter Notebook server is running, you cancel the running process. The terminal goes back to command line and you can exit the virtual environment by typing `conda deactivate`.

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
conda deactivate
```

### Spyder

The [Spyder IDE](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/) can be started in a terminal when the *Spyder* package is installed in the active conda environment. So, using *Mamba*, make an environment and install Spyder to that environment. Activate the environment. Spyder will automatically make use of the Python interpreter of the active conda environment. To start Spyder:

```{r, eval=FALSE,engine='bash'}
spyder
```

In Spyder you should see an editor, a file explorer and a console. Have a look at the toolbar. Some important shortcuts are:

* F5 to run your script
* CTRL + S to save your script
* CTRL + 1 to comment/uncomment your code
* TAB to indent your code
* SHIFT + TAB to unindent your code

Open a new file and save it somewhere as `main.py` (File -- > New File --> Save As). Test writing a few lines of code and running the script.

# Python refresher

## Setting up the environment

In the second part of this tutorial we will refresh your python knowledge and build upon it. Again, we advise you to code in Spyder, as this IDE is the recommended IDE for the python part of this course. 

First, make a directory structure for this tutorial:

```{r, eval=FALSE,engine='bash'}
cd ~/Documents/
mkdir PythonRefresher #or give the directory a name to your liking
cd ./PythonRefresher
mkdir output
```

We only make a directory for output, because no input data or separate scripts are created in this tutorial. Next, we will create a conda environment from a file. First create a text file in your preferred text editor, e.g. `gedit`. Then, (re)name it (to) `refresher.yaml`, and copy the following content into the file:

```
name: refresher
dependencies:
  - python
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - geopandas
  - spyder
```

Now, create a new conda environment based on this file:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
mamba env create --file refresher.yaml
```

Once everything is installed, activate the environment and start Spyder:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
source activate refresher
spyder
```

Create a new Python script and save it. 

Important to note: for compatibility, it is best to install packages from the same channel as much as possible. Given that packages in the file `refresher.yaml` are installed from the `conda-forge` channel, it is wise to use this same channel when you want to install additional packages in your environment. 


## Quick refresher
In the tutorial about R and Python we have gone over the differences and similarities of python and R. This tutorial also contains some basic python syntax, in this tutorial we assume you know this content, but we will go over a few basics here as well. The example below are mostly meant for reference purposes, we  assume you understand most of this refresher already. 

### Printing and basic data types
In python we assign variable using the equals sign (`=`):

Printing in python is done using the `print` function. We can print variables directly: 

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
# Integer
age = 25

# Float
height = 1.75

# String
name = "John Doe"

# Boolean
is_student = True

# Print a name
print(name)
```

We can use string formatting to use flexible strings, for example for printing. to start a formatted string, we put a `f` before the string. We can use curly brackets `{}` in this formatted string. The text between these curly brackets is executed as regular python code. 

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
# String formatting and printing 
print(f'{name} is {age} years old and is {height} meters tall.)
```

### Basic arithmetic operations:
```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
a = 10
b = 5

addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b
modulo = a % b
exponentiation = a ** b

print(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponentiation)
```


### Conditional statements
```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
x = 15

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than 10")
```


### Loops (for and while)
```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Lists and basic list operations
```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Accessing elements
print(fruits[0])  # Output: "apple"

# Adding elements
fruits.append("grape")

# Removing elements
fruits.remove("banana")

# Length of the list
print(len(fruits))  # Output: 3
```


### Functions
```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
# Function to add two numbers and return the result
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```


### Dictionaries
```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
# Creating a dictionary
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "is_student": False
}

# Accessing values
print(person["name"])  # Output: "Alice"

# Adding a new key-value pair
person["occupation"] = "Engineer"

# Removing a key-value pair
del person["is_student"]
```


### Importing packages
Python is used by a very large community, as is said before. One of the reasons for this is that this entire community builds a lot of (open source) packages. It is therefor very useful to be able to build upon these packages. In R you have worked a with *dataframes* and *spatial dataframes*. In Python these are not standard datatypes, but they are implemented in very well known packages called `Pandas` and its spatial counterpart `GeoPandas.` We will go in much more detail during the Python-Vector tutorial but we will introduce them quickly here. 

In python we import a package using the `import` statement (instead of th the `library` function in R) . For example importing the pandas package goes as follows

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
import pandas as pd
```

As you can see we can import a package *as* something. We use this if we want to point at specific functionality of this package. If we want to point at for example the `read_csv` function from pandas we we call `pd.read_csv`. This function is also implemented in other packages, but now we are sure we use the pandas version of this function. Importing pandas is a convention, used very widely in the python community. 

We can create a `dataframe` as follows: 
```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 22],
    'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Chicago']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```   

We can access some information from this `dataframe` as follows:

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Get statistical information about the DataFrame
print(df.describe())

# Access a specific column
print(df['Age'])
```   

### GeoDataFrame
The spatial counterpart of a `dataframe` is a 'GeoDataFrame', which we normally import *as* `gpd`: 
```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
import geopandas as gpd

# Dummy data for the GeoDataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Location A', 'Location B', 'Location C'],
    'Latitude': [40.7128, 34.0522, 41.8781],
    'Longitude': [-74.0060, -118.2437, -87.6298]
}

# Create the GeoDataFrame with a single line of code
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(data, geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(data['Longitude'], data['Latitude']))

# Display the GeoDataFrame
print(gdf)
```


## Object-Oriented Programming in Python
We have now gone over most of the more basic basic functionality of Python, a lot of similar things you have used in R. A concept we have not used before is the concept of objects. They have shortly been introduced in R, but we will elaborate on them in Python. Up until now, in this course we have looked at R mainly as a scripting language, we call this way of programming Procedural Programming. Both Python and R can be used in another programming paradigm: Object Oriented Programming. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of programming where functionality and information is encapsulated in objects. Instead of assigning variables and functions, objects are used where both values (properties) and calculations (methods) can be stored together. This offers several advantages. OOP promotes modularity and re-usability by breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable units, these are the objects. These objects can be reused in various parts of the program or even in other projects, leading to more efficient, scalable and organized programming. Especially when working on projects containing lots of code OOP will make your work a lot easier to understand for you and others and it is easier to re-use parts of the code. 

### How to work with objects in Python
In Python, objects are created and manipulated using classes. A class serves as a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It brings together data (properties) and functions (methods) into a single object. To define a class in Python, we use the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class. Let's take a look at an example of a simple class called `Person`:

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # < this is a property
        self.age = age    # < this is also a property
    
    def greet(self):  # < This "function" is a method
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.")
```

In the provided code, the `__init__` method is a special method known as a *constructor*. It is automatically called when an object is created from the class. The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the class itself, allowing access to its properties and methods. Whenever a method is defined within a `class`, we give `self` as the first parameter. 

The `Person` class has two properties, `name` and `age`, as well as one method, `greet`. The `greet` method prints a greeting message that includes the person's name and age.

To create an instance of the `Person` class, you simply call the class as if it were a function and assign the result to a variable:

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
person2 = Person("Bob", 30)
```

We have created two objects, `person1` and `person2`, which are instances of the `Person` class. Now we can access the properties and call the methods of these objects:

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice
print(person2.age)   # Output: 30
person1.greet()      # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 25 years old.
person2.greet()      # Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I'm 30 years old.
```

This example is straightforward, but keep in mind that classes can become more complex. 

```{block, type="alert alert-success"}
> **Question 1**: Take a look at the creation of a GeoPandas `GeoSeries` [here](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/blob/main/geopandas/geoseries.py#L83). It may seem complicated and hard to read, but it is well-documented, so try to understand some of its functionality. The `to_json` method, for example, provides straightforward functionality (though it may still be challenging to read due to its complexity). 
```

You may have noticed that class definitions differ from what we have learned. In the `GeoPandas` example, the class is defined as follows:

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
class GeoSeries(GeoPandasBase, Series):
```

However, we previously learned to define a class like this:

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
class GeoSeries:
```

The difference lies in the code within the parentheses, which represents *inheritance*. The class will inherit all the functionality from the classes specified as arguments, in this case, `GeoPandasBase` and `Series`. The `Series` object refers to the [Pandas.Series](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/core/series.py#L243C15-L243C15), which contains thousands of lines of code with various functionality. Therefore, the GeoPandas `GeoSeries` contains all the functionality implemented in Pandas, as well as those from `GeoPandasBase` and `GeoPandas.Series`itself. When new functionality is developed for the `Pandas` package, this is directly available in the `GeoPandas` objects, since we inherit all functionality from pandas.

Phew, that's a lot of complicated code, and it may seem overwhelming. You don't need to understand every detail. The important thing is to grasp the value of classes, objects, and inheritance. When creating a class, we can inherit functionality from another class. How does this work in a simple example?

So, we've learned that with inheritance, classes can acquire all the functionality from other classes and build upon that. Let's create a new object called `Student`, which will inherit all the properties and methods from the `Person` class we defined earlier.

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.student_id = student_id
        self.is_studying = False
    
    def study(self):
        self.is_studying = True
        print(f"{self.name} is studying.")
```

In the provided code, the `Student` class inherits from the `Person` class, which we will refer to as the superclass. By doing so, it extends the functionality of the superclass by adding a new property (`student_id`) and a new method (`study`). The `super()` function is used to call the superclass's `__init__` method, allowing the subclass to initialize the inherited properties.

As a result, the `Student` class contains both the methods and properties inherited from the `Person` class, as well as the additional ones defined within the `Student` class:

```{r, engine = 'Python', eval=FALSE}
student = Student("Eve", 22, "123456")
print(student.name)         # Output: Eve
print(student.student_id)   # Output: 123456
student.greet()             # Output: Hello, my name is Eve and I'm 22 years old.
student.study()             # Output: Eve is studying.
```

In this example, `student` is an instance of the `Student` class. It can access the inherited properties from the `Person` class, such as `name`, as well as the newly added property `student_id` and `is_studying`, which defaults to `False`. Similarly, it can invoke both the inherited method `greet` and the additional method `study`, which are specific to the `Student` class. The method `study` prints a message and sets the `is_studying` property to `True`.

```{block, type="alert alert-success"}
> **Question 2**: Create a new class called `Teacher`. This new class also inherits from `Person`. Define a method for the teacher that checks whether a student is studying. The student should be an input to the method. 
```

## Visualization 
Visualization is essential to make concepts understandable and patterns recognizable. In Python, _Matplotlib_ is a general plotting package. It is used as a base for many other, more tailored, packages. One of the core advantages of Matplotlib is that the representation of figure is separated from the act of rendering it. This enables building increasingly sophisticated features and logic into the figure, a bit like making a map in a GIS.

In Matplotlib, a *figure* object contains *axes*, or subplots. These axes contain an x-axis, a y-axis and can contain lines and text. This hierarchy is important to understand when you want to edit a plot:

<figure>

<figcaption>Matplotlib hierarchy of figure elements, source https://www.aosabook.org/en/matplotlib.html.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figcaption>Elements in an example Matplotlib figure, source https://www.aosabook.org/en/matplotlib.html.</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's create a simple line figure, based on data in `NumPy.array`s.

```{Python,engine.path='/usr/bin/python3'}
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Create some data
x = np.arange(-np.pi, np.pi, 0.2)
y = np.sin(x)

# Plot x against y
plt.plot(x, y)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

<img src="images/mpl1.png" alt="matplotlib simple figure" width="50%"></img>

Note that the behavior of `plt.show()` depends on how you run the script. If you are using Spyder and want `plt.show()` to work:

1.	Go to Tools.
2.	Go to Preferences.
3.	Select IPython console.
4.	Go to Graphics tab.
5.	In the Graphics backend section, select Automatic as the backend type.
6.  Restart your kernel.

Instead of a single plot, the figure can have subplots (here two). Using the `sharex` and/or `sharey` argument, the axes can be aligned automatically, for easy comparison between the subplots. Also, we can add a title and axis labels. Finally, we can change the positions of the tick marks on an axis to something meaningful in the context of trigonometric functions and customize the labels with regular text or lateX. Check if you understand what object in the hierarchy is edited and why.

```{Python,engine.path='/usr/bin/python3'}
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Create some data
x1 = np.arange(-np.pi, np.pi, 0.2)
y1 = np.sin(x1)
x2 = np.arange(-np.pi, 0, 0.2)
y2 = np.cos(x2)

# Initiate a figure with two subplots 
f, axarr = plt.subplots(2, sharex=True)

# Subplots are stored in an array
line = axarr[0].plot(x1, y1)
axarr[0].set_title('plot 1')
axarr[1].plot(x2, y2)
axarr[1].set_title('plot 2')
f.suptitle('super title', fontsize=16)

# Axis label
axarr[1].set_xlabel('x')
axarr[0].set_ylabel('sin(x)')
axarr[1].set_ylabel('cos(x)')

# Axis ticks and tick labels
xticks = axarr[1].get_xticks()
print(xticks)
new_ticks = np.arange(-np.pi, np.pi + 0.1, 0.25 * np.pi)
new_labels = [r"$-\pi$", r"$-\frac{3}{4}\pi$",
              r"$-\frac{1}{2}\pi$", r"$-\frac{1}{4}\pi$",
              "$0$", r"$\frac{1}{4}\pi$",
              r"$\frac{1}{2}\pi$", r"$\frac{3}{4}\pi$",
              r"$2\pi$"]
axarr[1].set_xticks(new_ticks)
axarr[1].set_xticklabels(new_labels)
plt.show()
```

One can also create multiple subplots (axes) and use different plotting styles, changing e.g. the marker style, line style, marker size, and colors. Furthermore, for the upper left subplot it is demonstrated how to add a legend; adding a label to the plotted line is essential for this.

```{Python,engine.path='/usr/bin/python3'}
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# New: define number of rows and columns of subplots and unpack them directly 
# into variables that then each contain one axes object
f, ((ax0, ax1), (ax2, ax3)) = plt.subplots(2, 2)

# Dashed line, label for legend, and show the legend on the subplot
ax0.plot(x, y, 'r--', label='red dashed line')
ax0.legend(loc='lower right')

# Scatter plot, using a colormap based on the y-value, changing the marker size to 35
ax1.scatter(x, y, c=y, cmap='bwr', s=35)

# Bar chart, changing the bar color to black
ax2.bar(x, y, color='k')

# Horizontal bar chart, changing the bar color to yellow
ax3.barh(x, y, color='y')
plt.show()
```

> **Question 3**: In the upper right subplot, why is there no point at x=3, y=8?.
```

When working with spatial data, it is crucial that the spatial scale (aspect) in the x and y direction is the same. Because Matplotlib can be used for plotting any kind of data, not necessarily spatial, it does not automatically do this. We can use `plt.axis('equal')`, or `ax.set_aspect('equal')` on the axis, to ensure equal scales in both directions. Let's test this on the non-spatial data in the plots above, see what happens (make sure to adjust the code above properly, and replace `plt.show()` with the code below). Adjust the Spyder working directory by clicking on the directory icon in the top right pane if necessary.

```{Python,engine.path='/usr/bin/python3'}
ax0.set_aspect('equal')
ax1.set_aspect('equal')
ax2.set_aspect('equal')
ax3.set_aspect('equal')
plt.savefig('output/equal_scale.png')
```

# Python help

There are several ways to find help with programming in Python. Searching the internet typically solves your problem the quickest, because it finds answers on multiple platforms, such as StackOverflow and Github. During Geoscripting we have the forum to ask and give help. Asking your friends or colleagues in person is also a great way to learn and fix programming problems. Another good option is get documentation from the package website or inside Python:

```{Python,engine.path='/usr/bin/python3', eval=FALSE}
import sys
help(sys)
```

See how the objects and functions in the `sys` package got listed.

```{block, type="alert alert-success"}
> **Question 4**: What kind of functionality does the `sys` package provide?
